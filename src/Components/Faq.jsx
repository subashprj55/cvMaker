          Curriculum Vitae, commonly abbreviated as CV, is a document that provides a comprehensive overview of a person's education, work experience, skills, achievements, and other relevant qualifications. A CV is typically used in academic and research settings, as well as in some industries, when applying for positions that require a high level of expertise or specialized knowledge.

            CV or resume is an abbreviation of the Latin words 'curriculum
            vitae', which mean 'life course'. A professional resume provides a
            summary and a good overview of someone's life. Your resume includes
            your education(s) and qualifications, work experience, skills, and
            important qualities. By means of your resume, your potential
            employer will be able to get a good picture of your skills, work
            experience, and knowledge quickly, to assess whether or not you fit
            the job, and therefore whether to offer you a job interview.
